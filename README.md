# Fly a present-like rocket to Trương Bùi Anh Tuấn.

This is my very first game project made in Unity. It's super simple and there's nothing too crazy about it. Though saying that, it bears a __gigantic sentimental value__ for **Trương Bùi Anh Tuấn**, who is the person I wish to dedicate this game towards.
